# Owlbear Codeo

_The root of all `eval`â„¢_

This extension allows you to manage custom user scripts for the Owlbear Rodeo VTT.

## Features

-   Create and edit custom scripts directly from the extension
-   Import scripts from external sources and update them if those sources change
-   Download and upload scripts
-   Track actively running scripts

## How to use

TODO

### Installing scripts

TODO

Some scripts to get you started:

-   [Inversionify](https://gist.github.com/desain/38977393433dfc6242eab280abe416fa) - turns a shape into an X-ray viewer
-   [Live Line](https://gist.github.com/desain/cbfdce2b7329fcae2919a479ff1d3e44) - select two tokens and a line, and the line will move to connect the tokens even if you move them.
-   [Shake it Off](https://gist.github.com/desain/5315c2c18ba469cd85534e8c29f8abbc) - shake the screen when selected tokens move.

### Writing scripts

TODO

Script parameters are all optional - be sure to handle `undefined` valuees.

Scripts have access to the `OBR` object from the Owlbear Rodeo SDK, as well as the type-check functions (e.g `isImage`), and the builders (e.g `buildImage`).

Scripts also have access to this object:

```typescript
interface Codeo {
    /**
     * If the script has an active execution, calls the execution's stop() function and removes
     * the execution.
     */
    stopSelf(): void;
}
```

### Calling this extension from other extensions

Dump this into your extension:

```typescript
type ScriptSelector = { name: string } | { id: string };
type RunScriptMessage = ScriptSelector & {
    type: "RUN_SCRIPT";
    replyTo?: string;
    destination?: NonNullable<
        Parameters<typeof OBR.broadcast.sendMessage>[2]
    >["destination"];
};
type StopExecutionMessage = ScriptSelector &
    Readonly<{
        type: "STOP_EXECUTION";
        executionId: string;
    }>;

type RunScriptMessageResponse = Readonly<{
    executionId: string;
}>;

const codeo = (message: RunScriptMessage | StopExecutionMessage) =>
    OBR.broadcast.sendMessage("com.desain.codeo/message", message, {
        destination: "LOCAL",
    });
```

Then call the `codeo` function to send messages to your local copy of the extension.

The `replyTo` and `destination` parameters allow you to receive a reply of type `RunScriptMessage` in the `replyTo` channel. The execution ID can then be passed in a `StopExecutionMessage`.

## Support

If you need support for this extension you can message me in the [Owlbear Rodeo Discord](https://discord.com/invite/u5RYMkV98s) @Nick or open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/desain/owlbear-codeo/issues).

## Development

After checkout, run `pnpm install`.

## How it Works

This project is a Typescript React app using Vite.

The `action.html` page is rendered in the `renderAction.tsx` file, which calls OBR APIs to set up the context menu and installs handlers to manage auras.

UI is built using Material UI React components.

## Building

This project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as a package manager.

To install all the dependencies run:

`pnpm install`

To run in a development mode run:

`pnpm dev`

To make a production build run:

`pnpm build`

## To do

-   Figure out a better way to pass the OBR APIs than as AsyncFunction args. https://www.totaltypescript.com/tips/turn-a-module-into-a-type?
-   Figure out a way to share scripts with others in the room, or with yourself on different devices
    -   Player metadata: goes away when you leave
    -   Local storage: Doesn't sync between devices
    -   Room metadata: 16KB limit shared between extensions, not good for large text like scripts
        -   Store urls in metadata and load all on extension load?
    - Tool metadata is in local storage, so no advantage over zustand persist
    - Firestore? (nosql)
    - Suprabase? (postgres)
-   Favorites system
-   Script icons
-   Add simple bar for scrolls
-   More parameter types
    -   Location?
    -   Item list?
    -   Asset
-   Add API for setting parameters
-   Move create buttons to the bottom of the script list
-   Set tool metadata on load
-   Ctrl/Cmd + S shortcut for editor
-   Utility methods for codeo object
    - Get item name / names
    - Something to follow the common pattern of getting the selection, validating it, watching the targets, and when some validation passes on an update, executing some logic and updating some shared state
- Sort by recently run
- Download as source with annotations
- Move parameters to the card dropdown
- Give settings popover its own id
- Use useRehydrate from utils
