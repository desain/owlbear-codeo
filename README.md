## Development

After checkout, run `pnpm install`.

## How it Works

This project is a Typescript app.

The `action.html` page is rendered in the 'renderAction.tsx' file, which calls OBR APIs to set up the context menu and installs handlers to manage auras.

## Building

This project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as a package manager.

To install all the dependencies run:

`pnpm install`

To run in a development mode run:

`pnpm dev`

To make a production build run:

`pnpm build`
